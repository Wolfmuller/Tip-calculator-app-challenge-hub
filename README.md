# Tip-calculator-app-challenge-hub
## A Tip calculator challenge that I built via Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/). This challange was a junior challenge that tested my skills in css and javascript. Here is a link ot the project: https://wolfmuller.github.io/Tip-calculator-app-challenge-hub/

## Table of Contents:
-**images** Icons used in the app, inclucing the dollar sign and the person icon.

-**Index.html** The html file of the app.

-**js.js** The javascript file.

-**styles.css**  The css file.

## Usage:
The user enters a value in the bill's input. The user then enters the amount of people the bill and tip should be split up by. Finally the user can click on a percentage button of either 5%, 10%, 15%, 25% and 50%. There is a custom percentage button too which prompts the user to enter a custom percentage should they wish. 
The app calculates the tip amount owed per person as well as the total amount owed per person. 

Example of a ten percent tip
